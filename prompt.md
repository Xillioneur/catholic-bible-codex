Build Catholic Bible Codex, a premium, modern Progressive Web Application for reading, studying, and praying with the full Catholic Bible (73-book canon).

Internal code name: Verbum Domini

All development must follow exactly these three living documents without deviation:

@master-technology-stack-requirements-specification.md
@software-requirements-specification.md  (the SRS for the Catholic version with NABRE, RSV-2CE, Douay-Rheims, Deuterocanonical books emphasized, daily Mass readings, Catechism links, patristic commentary, Lectio Divina, etc.)
@software-design-document.md  (the latest SDD v1.4 for Catholic Bible Codex with the modern design, no parchment/codex visuals, full MTSRS compliance)

First actions:
1. Read and deeply understand all three attached documents in full. Confirm you have internalized the MTSRS v1.0 as the absolute foundation (TypeScript strict, Next.js 16+ App Router, React Server Components default, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Prisma + PostgreSQL, tRPC + TanStack Query, Auth.js v5, Serwist PWA, etc.).
2. Confirm the public name is Catholic Bible Codex – The Catholic Bible.
3. Confirm the design is 100% modern, minimalist, serene, digital-native — no parchment, no book textures, no page-turn effects, no illuminated manuscript styling.
4. Confirm the core experience priorities: immersive Scripture reading, parallel translations, daily Mass readings on home screen, personal study tools (bookmarks, highlights, Markdown notes), Catechism/patristic/Lectio links, offline-first PWA excellence (Lighthouse 98+), liturgical color system.

Begin however you like. You have free reign of the project and its commands, Gemini.
